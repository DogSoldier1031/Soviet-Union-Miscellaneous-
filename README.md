Soviet Union (Miscellaneous)

"In 1956 the USSR reduced the workweek for a l l workers and employees from 48 to 46 hours and announced plans for a further gradual reduction to 41 hours by the end of 1960. After lagging badly during 1957-58,
the program was sharply accelerated in 1959-60, and by t h e end o f 1960 all workers and employees had been transferred to the shorter workweek.
The reduction of the workweek was accomplished largely without lowering average weekly earnings, without underfulfillment of production plans, and with substantial increases In output per man and per man-hour. In addition, higher "technically based" work norms have been established, the wage and bonus structure has been rationalized, and progressive piece rates have been deemphasized. The Seven Year Plan (1959-65), published in February 1959, specified that an additional hour was to
be cut from the workweek in 1962 and that the s h i f tt o a 35-hour work- week was to begin in 1964 and to be completed in 1968."
