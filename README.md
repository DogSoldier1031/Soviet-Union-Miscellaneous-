(FROM THE CIA) “Even In Stalin's time there was collective leadership. The Western idea of a dictator within the Communist setup is exaggerated. Misunderstandings on that subject are caused by lack of comprehension of the real nature and organi- zation of the Communist power structure. Stalin, although holding wide powers, was merely the captain of a team and I t seems obvious that Khrushchev will be the new captain. However, 1t does not appear that any of the present leaders will rise to the stature of Lenin and Stalin,so that it will be safer to assume that developments in Moscow will be along the lines of what is called collective leadership, unless Western policies force the Soviets to streamline their power organization. The present situation is the most favorable from the point of view of upsetting the Communist dictatorship since the death of Stalin:” https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A006000360009-0.pdf

“Stalin was not Russian: his real name was Ioseb Dzhugashvili, and he came from Georgia. Russian was not his native language; he did not begin to learn it until he was eight years old and always had a foreign accent when speaking the language.” https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news-story-of-the-georgian-language-7805026/

“What is a nation? A nation is primarily a community, a definite community of people. This community is not racial, nor is it tribal. The modern Italian nation was formed from Romans, Teutons, Etruscans, Greeks, Arabs, and so forth. The French nation was formed from Gauls, Romans, Britons, Teutons, and so on. The same must be said of the British, the Germans and others, who were formed into nations from people of diverse races and tribes. Thus, a nation is not a racial or tribal, but a historically constituted community of people.” -J.V. Stalin https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03a.htm#s1

“I think that the scheme you propose, with its new, fifth characteristic of the concept "nation," is profoundly mistaken and cannot be justified either theoretically or in practice, politically. pAccording to your scheme, only such nations are to be recognised as nations as have their own state, separate from others, whereas all oppressed nations which have no independent statehood would have to be deleted from the category of nations; moreover, the struggle of oppressed nations against national oppression and the struggle of colonial peoples against imperialism would have to be excluded from the concept "national movement" and "national-liberation movement." More than that. According to your scheme we would have to assert: a) that the Irish became a nation only after the formation of the "Irish Free State," and that before that they did not constitute a nation; b) that the Norwegians were not a nation before Norway's secession from Sweden, and became a nation only after that secession; c) that the Ukrainians were not a nation when the Ukraine formed part of tsarist Russia; that they became a nation only after they seceded from Soviet Russia under the Central Rada and Hetman Skoropadsky, but again ceased to be a nation after they united their Ukrainian Soviet Republic with the other Soviet Republics to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. A great many such examples could be cited. Obviously, a scheme which leads to such absurd conclusions cannot be regarded as a scientific scheme." -J.V. Stalin https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1929/03/18.htm

“Their [kulak] opposition took the initial form of slaughtering their cattle and horses in preference to having them collectivized. The result was a grievous blow to Soviet agriculture, for most of the cattle and horses were owned by the kulaks. Between 1928 and 1933 the number of horses in the USSR declined from almost 30,000,000 to less than 15,000,000; of horned cattle from 70,000,000 (including 31,000,0000 cows) to 38,000,000 (including 20,000,000 cows); of sheep and goats from 147,000,000 to 50,000,000; and of hogs from 20,000,000 to 12,000,000. Soviet rural economy had not recovered from this staggering loss by 1941. […] Some [kulaks] murdered officials, set the torch to the property of the collectives, and even burned their own crops and seed grain. More refused to sow or reap, perhaps on the assumption that the authorities would make concessions and would in any case feed them. The aftermath was the ‘Ukraine famine’ of 1932—33 [….] Lurid accounts, mostly fictional, appeared in the Nazi press in Germany and in the Hearst press in the United States, often illustrated with photographs that turned out to have been taken along the Volga in 1921 [….] The ‘famine’ was not, in its later stages, a result of food shortage, despite the sharp reduction of seed grain and harvests flowing from special requisitions in the spring of 1932 which were apparently occasioned by fear of war in Japan. Most of the victims were kulaks who had refused to sow their fields or had destroyed their crops.” – Frederick Schuman, quoted in Douglas Tottle, “Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard,” page 93-94.

The Soviets were one of the later European nations to sign a treaty with Nazi Germany: Four-Power Pact (July 1933) German–Polish declaration of non-aggression (January 1934) Anglo-German Naval Agreement (June 1935) Juliabkommen (July 1936) German-Romanian Treaty for the Development of Economic Relations between the Two Countries (March 1939) German–Estonian Non-Aggression Pact (June 7, 1939) German–Latvian Non-Aggression Pact (June 7, 1939) Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact (August 1939)

“The Soviet Union is estimated to have suffered the highest number of WWII casualties. As many as 27 million Soviets lost their lives, with as many as 11.4 million military deaths joined by up to 10 million civilian deaths due to military activity and an additional 8 million to 9 million deaths due to famine and disease. Those totals do not include the more than 14 million Soviet soldiers who were wounded during the war. Among the Soviet Union's 15 republics, Russia withstood the highest number of casualties, with 6,750,000 military deaths and 7,200,000 civilian deaths. Ukraine tallied the second-highest casualties, with 1,650,000 military deaths and 5,200,000 civilian deaths.” https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/world-war-two-casualties-by-country#

“Historical ties between Russia and Africa Russia’s engagement with African countries is not new. Backed by its ideological commitment to decolonisation, Russia’s communist predecessor, the Soviet Union, established partnerships with African countries soon after they claimed independence. Its involvement was driven by a mixture of ideological commitment, pragmatic economic interests, and the need to build alliances in the Cold War.” https://www.greeneuropeanjournal.eu/why-russia-finds-friends-in-africa/

“How the Soviet Union helped Nelson Mandela No discussion about South Africa and Nelson Mandela’s struggle against the tyranny of apartheid can be complete without mentioning the role of the Soviet Union” https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/opinion/10539128/soviet-union-nelson-mandela.html

“Throughout his presidency, Reagan supported the apartheid government in South Africa and even labeled Nelson Mandela’s African National Congress a notorious terrorist organization. We speak with South African activist Father Michael Lapsley who lost his hands, one eye and was burned severely in an assassination attempt under the De Klerk government. Former South African President Nelson Mandela recently announced that he was retiring from public life. And Mandela will not be among the foreign dignitaries attending services for Ronald Reagan. After all, Mandela was languishing in a South African prison throughout the duration of Reagan’s presidency. But this history has been effectively re-written in the US. The dominant view is that the US was on the right side in South Africa, that it opposed apartheid. But nothing could be further from the truth, particularly when Reagan was president. Reagan labeled Mandela’s African National Congress a notorious terrorist organization, while continuing Washington’s support for the apartheid regime. In 1981, Reagan explained to CBS that he was loyal to the South African regime because it was “a country that has stood by us in every war we’ve ever fought, a country that, strategically, is essential to the free world in its production of minerals” https://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/11/allied_with_apartheid_reagan_supported_racist

(FROM THE CIA) "In 1956 the USSR reduced the workweek for a l l workers and employees from 48 to 46 hours and announced plans for a further gradual reduction to 41 hours by the end of 1960. After lagging badly during 1957-58,
the program was sharply accelerated in 1959-60, and by t h e end o f 1960 all workers and employees had been transferred to the shorter workweek.
The reduction of the workweek was accomplished largely without lowering average weekly earnings, without underfulfillment of production plans, and with substantial increases In output per man and per man-hour. In addition, higher "technically based" work norms have been established, the wage and bonus structure has been rationalized, and progressive piece rates have been deemphasized. The Seven Year Plan (1959-65), published in February 1959, specified that an additional hour was to
be cut from the workweek in 1962 and that the s h i f tt o a 35-hour work- week was to begin in 1964 and to be completed in 1968."

C.I.A. SAYS SOVIET CAN ALMOST DO WITHOUT IMPORTS (Jan. 9, 1983) “The Central Intelligence Agency, in a study of the Soviet economy, concludes that the Soviet Union's ability to live without imports is much greater than that of most, possibly all, other industrialized economies. The report, delivered to the Joint Economic Committee of Congress on Dec. 1 by Henry Rowen, chairman of the C.I.A.'s National Intelligence Council, seems to support the argument that American trade embargoes against the Soviet Union have only limited effect.” https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/09/world/cia-says-soviet-can-almost-do-without-imports.html#:~:text=He%20said%20the%20average%20Soviet,and%20meat%20and%20less%20sugar.

The Harvard Boys Do Russia (MAY 14, 1998) “After seven years of economic “reform” financed by billions of dollars in U.S. and other Western aid, subsidized loans and rescheduled debt, the majority of Russian people find themselves worse off economically. The privatization drive that was supposed to reap the fruits of the free market instead helped to create a system of tycoon capitalism run for the benefit of a corrupt political oligarchy that has appropriated hundreds of millions of dollars of Western aid and plundered Russia’s wealth.” https://www.thenation.com/article/world/harvard-boys-do-russia/tnamp/

Causes of declining life expectancy in Russia F C Notzon et al. JAMA. 1998. “The striking rise in Russian mortality is beyond the peacetime experience of industrialized countries, with a 5-year decline in life expectancy in 4 years' time. Many factors appear to be operating simultaneously, including economic and social instability, high rates of tobacco and alcohol consumption, poor nutrition, depression, and deterioration of the health care system. Problems in data quality and reporting appear unable to account for these findings. These results clearly demonstrate that major declines in health and life expectancy can take place rapidly.” https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9508159/
